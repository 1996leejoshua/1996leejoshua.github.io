					My name is Joshua Lee, and I am 20 years old. I am majoring in chemical engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara and entering the 2017-2018 school year as a junior. Outside of my engineering schedule, I enjoy taking music and philosophy classes. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and exploring Santa Barbara's landscape. My passion is engineering in the broadest sense of what I know it to be: to improve and innovate. I chose to puruse an engineering degree because I've always liked to be challenged in the way I think.

				I've recently developed an interest for programming and software development. I have experience working with Python on a Linux OS machine in my undergraduate research position. I've also started to learn some C++ in my free time to expand my programming skillset. My current side-project is the development and improvement of this website using HTML and CSS.

				Career-wise, I'm seeking an internship for the summer of 2018 in one of the following fields: <i>brewing, chemicals, consumer goods, data analysis, energy, finance, materials, software, or water treatment</i>. My research and work experience give me the technical and theoretical skills to quickly adapt to a new position. I aspire to provide real value in my professional career.
