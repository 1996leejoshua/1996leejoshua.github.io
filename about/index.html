	<p>My name is Joshua Lee, and I am 20 years old. I am majoring in chemical engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara and entering the 2017-2018 school year as a junior. Outside of my engineering schedule, I like to take music and philosophy classes. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and exploring Santa Barbara's landscapes. I'm currently working as an undergraduate research assistant in the Fredrickson Research Group at the Materials Research Laboratory. My research focus is on non-solvent induced phase separation for the production of asymmetric polymer membranes. My most recent project involved the development and debugging of algorithms coded in Python that perform 2D and 3D data and image analysis. I also have experience working as an assistant analytical chemist where I tested consumer products and managed exeperimental data. My notable academic projects include a bioengineering report on artifical pancreas systems, a feasability report on alternative materials for solar cells, and a technical report on a gas turbine engine system using bioethanol as a fuel source. Thus far, I've completed the following major courses: Introduction to Chemical Engineering (mass balances) and Thermodynamics.</p>
	<p>I've recently developed an interest for programming. I have experience working with Python on a Linux machine in my undergraduate research position. I've also started to learn some C++ to expand my programming skillset. My current side-project is the development and improvement of this website using HTML and CSS.</p> 
	<p>Career-wise, I'm seeking an internship for the summer of 2018 in one of the following fields: <i>chemicals, consumer goods, data analysis, energy, finance, materials, or water treatment</i>. My research and work experience give me the technical and theoretical skills to quickly adapt to a new position. I aspire to provide value in my professional career.</p>
