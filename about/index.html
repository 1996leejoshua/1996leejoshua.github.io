	<p>My name is Joshua Lee. I am 20 years old. I am Korean-American. I am majoring in chemical engineering at UCSB and entering the 2017-2018 school year as a junior. In my free time, I like to go outdoors to hike or run or stay indoors to practice acoustic guitar. Outside of my engineering schedule, I also like to take music and philosophy classes.</p>

	<p>Career-wise, I'm seeking an internship for the summer of 2018 in one of the following fields: <i>chemicals, consumer goods, data analysis, energy, finance, materials, or water treatment</i>. My coursework and research experience have given me the basic background and experience to learn and contribute to these fields. I am always trying to learn new things. I have recently become interested in the world of programming and I hope to somehow tie this passion into my future career.</p>
