				My name is Joshua Lee, and I am 20 years old. I am majoring in chemical engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara and entering the 2017-2018 school year as a junior. Outside of my engineering schedule, I enjoy taking music and philosophy classes. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and exploring Santa Barbara's landscape. My passion is engineering in the broadest sense of what I know it to be: to improve and innovate. I chose to puruse an engineering degree because I've always liked to be challenged in the way I think.

				I've recently developed an interest for programming and software development. I have experience working with Python on a Linux OS machine in my computational research position. I've developed and improved Python scripts that implement data and image analysis algorithms for both 2D and 3D data sets. I've applied the research to analyze a process for producing polymer membranes. I've also started to learn some C++ in my free time to expand my programming skillset. My current side-project is the development and improvement of this website using HTML and CSS. I also have working proficiency in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.
