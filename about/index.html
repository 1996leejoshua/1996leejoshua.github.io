	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>My name is Joshua Lee. I am 20 years old. I am Korean-American. I am majoring in chemical engineering at UCSB where I also participate in undergraduate research. In my free time, I like to go outdoors or stay indoors to pratice acoustic guitar. Outside of my engineering schedule, I also like to take music and philosophy classes.</p>

	<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
	<p>Career-wise, I'm seeking an internship for the summer of 2018 in one of the following fields: chemicals, consumer goods, data analysis, energy, finance, materials, or water treatment. My coursework and research experience have given me the basic knowledge background to tackle these fields. I am always trying to learn new things. I have recently become immersed in the world of programming and I hope to somehow tie this passion into my future career.</p>
