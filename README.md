This is a personal website and blog that I've built from scratch using HTML, CSS, Jekyll, and a lot of googling. My name is Joshua Lee, and I am a rising junior at University of California, Santa Barbara where I major in chemical engineering. This website is composed of a quick about, contact, blog, and resume.
