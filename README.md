My name is Joshua Lee, and I am 20 years old. I am entering my 3rd year as a chemical engineering major at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). This is my personal website and blog that I've developed as a creative project. It's main function is to provide information about who I am and what I do. The website will be updated as I gain more personal and professional experiences while the blog will be updated on a regular basis.
