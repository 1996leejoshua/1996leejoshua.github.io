My name is Joshua Lee, and I am a rising junior at University of California, Santa Barbara where I major in chemical engineering. This website utilizes pure CSS to implement a parallax effect. The site is built from scratch using HTML, CSS, Jekyll, and a lot of googling.

The home page consists of a short bio and contact information. The blog page includes blog posts of my collected thoughts and personal opinions. The resume page includes work experience, school history, and skills.
