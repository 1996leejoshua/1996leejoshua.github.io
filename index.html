				My name is Joshua Lee. I received my Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara. In my spare time, I enjoy coffee, reading, and outdoor activities. My passion is engineering in the broadest sense of what I know it to be: to improve and innovate. I chose to pursue an engineering degree because I've always liked to be challenged in the way I think. I'm pursuing a non-traditional engineering career using my engineering background to tackle new challenges.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm currently an Account Executive at SoCalGas where I manage large commercial and industrial accounts in Orange County and Los Angeles County. I previously worked as an engineering intern at SoCalGas where I performed energy efficiency and equipment site evaluations. I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant where I performed HPC simulations of polymer membranes used for water filtration. I developed and improved Python scripts that implement data and image analysis algorithms to analyze production of polymer membranes. I also learned HTML and CSS as a side project in order to create this website. I have prior work experience doing quality control tests on consumer products as an assistant analytical chemist where I also assisted in sample preparations and data documentation. I have working proficiency in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.
			</p> 
			<p>
				Career-wise, I'm interested in account management and project management. I offer a solid analytical and technical background with a demonstrated ability to learn new skills as can be seen in my self-teaching of programming and in the variety of my past roles. I'm excited to provide value in my professional career.
