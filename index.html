				My name is Joshua Lee, and I am 21 years old. I am majoring in chemical engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara and entering the 2017-2018 school year as a junior. Outside of my engineering schedule, I enjoy taking music and philosophy classes. In my spare time, I enjoy learning and preparing coffee in a variety of ways. My passion is engineering in the broadest sense of what I know it to be: to improve and innovate. I chose to pursue an engineering degree because I've always liked to be challenged in the way I think.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm currently working as an engineering intern at SoCalGas where I'm performing engineering audits and assisting with various duties at a natural gas storage and transmission facility. I previously worked as an undergraduate research assistant where I performed HPC simulations of polymer membranes used for water filtration. I developed and improved Python scripts that implement data and image analysis algorithms to analyze production of polymer membranes. I also learned HTML and CSS as a side project in order to create this website. I have prior work experience doing quality control tests on consumer products as an assistant analytical chemist, and I also assisted in sample preparations and data documentation. I also have working proficiency in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.
			</p> 
			<p>
				Career-wise, I wish to pursue a career in clean energy. I offer a solid analytical and technical background with a demonstrated ability to learn new skills as can be seen in my self-teaching of programming. I'm excited to provide value in my professional career.
