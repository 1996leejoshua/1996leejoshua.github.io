	<p>My first exposure to the world of programming was a MATLAB class in Spring 2016. It was a complete failure of a class for me. Coding was so new to me, and it took me the better half of the class before I finally had a slight grasp on the material. I hated it, but I loved it. I decided to seek a computational research position to build on my failure. I started my research experience at the end of the summer in 2016. </p>

	<p>To be honest, I didn't invest as much time as I should have on my research, and it showed in the rate of my progress. It took me almost the entirety of my Fall and Winter quarters for me to produce a quantitative result that my postdoc could use in his research paper. I was lucky enough to  be offered a paid summer research position when I reached out to my professor. I'm ext</p>

	<p>My undergraduate research focus is on theoretical and computational polymer science. My work during the school year involved a Python script that calculates the surface tensions of membrane interfaces; furthermore, I analyzed data to determine the relationship between compositons and surface tensions. I am currently performing phase field simulations on non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) for the production of asymmetric polymer membranes used in water purification. Thus far, I have updated 2D data and image analysis algorithms to stable 3D versions using Python. I've also written my own code to support and expand the existing code for these algorithms. My most recent endeavor has been a new project on the effect of additives in the NIPS process.</p>
