	<p>My first exposure to the world of programming was a MATLAB class in Spring 2016. It was a complete failure of a class for me. Coding was so new to me, and it took me the better half of the class before I finally had a slight grasp on the material. I hated it, but I loved it. I decided to seek a computational research position to build on my failure. I started my research experience at the end of the summer in 2016. </p>

	<p>To be honest, I spent less than 10 hours a week on my research, and it showed in the sluggish progress I made. It took me almost the entirety of Fall and Winter Quarter for me to produce any kind of result that my postdoc could use in his research paper. It wasn't until I was offered a paid summer research position that I truly immersed myself into programming.</p>

	<p>In the summer of 2017, I started my work on performing phase field simulations on non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) for the production of asymmetric polymer membranes used in water purification. My work involved updating 2D data and image analysis algorithms to stable 3D versions in Python. I've also written my own code to support and expand the existing code for these algorithms. Currently, I am starting a new project on the effect of additives in the NIPS process.</p>
