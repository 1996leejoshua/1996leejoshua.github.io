	<p>My undergraduate research focus is on theoretical and computational polymer science. My first project was to write a Python script that calculates the surface tensions of membrane interfaces; furthermore, I analyzed data to determine the relationship between compositons and surface tensions. I am currently performing phase field simulations on non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) for the production of asymmetric polymer membranes used in water purification. Thus far, I have updated 2D data and image analysis algorithms to stable 3D versions using Python. I've also written my own code to support and expand the existing code for these algorithms. My most recent endeavor has been a new project on the effect of additives in the NIPS process.</p>
	<p>The image below was generated from the group's 3D data and image analysis algorithms I improved using Python. The algorithms check for the continuity, shape, and size of polymer phases.</p>
