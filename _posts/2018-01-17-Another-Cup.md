For my first post of 2018, I envisioned something more along the lines of a New Year's resolutions kind of post. However, I wanted to deviate from the idea of a "new year, new me" this year. Like most people, I've given up one too many resolutions in the weeks following the new year. Therefore, I'd much rather share about something that I've grown increasingly passionate about in the passing months: coffee. 

If you've read my other blog post titled "Coffee," then you will know that I was just getting into the coffee scene with my cold brewing contraption. 

I've since moved onto preparing my coffee via the pourover and french press methods. This move was pushed by my friends and family gifting me a complete coffee set for my 21st birthday. My current set of coffee gear includes: Baratza Encore grinder, Hario V60 02, Hario Buono kettle, Hario glass server, AWS scale, and Kona french press.

I've since dialed in my pourover technique, and thus, over the last several months, have experienced a new love for coffee. I never knew coffee could be so complex. I've been mildly addicted to learning as much about the entire spectrum of coffee: sourcing, roasting, and brewing.

My current favorite region of coffee is the Yirgacheffe region in Ethiopia. The various beans I've had from various roasters have all been absolutely fantastic. The sweetness of the blueberry notes is in perfect harmony with the overall clean cup. I tend to like all my beans light to light-medium on the roasting scale (right after first crack). My current brewing method with the V60 is the following:

- 1:16.667 ratio of coffee to water
- Water 30 seconds off the boil (unfortunately, I do not currently have a thermometer)
- Pre-wet the filter and dump the water
- Drop the grounds in
- Bloom with two times the coffee weight and immediately stir with a spoon to ensure even extraction
- Wait 10 seconds before pouring the rest of the water over the grounds in a concentric circular motion (not pouring too fast or too slow)
- As the water drains, pick up V60 and give it a couple swirls to make sure the bed is flat and extracts evenly in the final moments
- Pour into your favorite mug and enjoy!

For those unfamiliar with the terminology I used, fear not for my following posts will be in-depth guides on how I brew my coffee with everything explained.
