Coffee. It's something we either live or die by. As somewhat of a coffee enthusiast, I do enjoy a quality cup of coffee every morning. Whenever I travel, I make it a point to visit a new coffee shop. Even as I'm writing this, I'm drinking a fantastic coffee at a local coffee shop, Restoration Roasters, in my hometown of Corona, CA. If I have free time, I'm usually found on my laptop at a coffee shop. Need to study? Coffee shop. Want to talk? Coffee Shop. Just bored? Coffee Shop. 

Recently, I've even started to homebrew coffee via the cold brew method. My current selection of coffee beans is from <a href="https://www.dunecoffeeroasters.com/" target="blank">Dune Coffee Roasters</a>. I use a manual burr grinder to get a consistent grind, and my vessel includes a filter in an airtight container. I've found that a nice medium-coarse to coarse grind works extremely well for a 24 hour extraction. 

I'm the type of guy who likes to know the facts and science of what I do. In this case, that includes the chemistry of coffee. Everything from the different flavor profiles associated with different extraction times, the acids associated with coffee, to the temperature at which coffee is brewed.

The next step in improving my cold brew involves the "hot bloom" method. This method involves a small amount of hot water at the beginning of the cold brew process. Noramlly, a cold brew extraction only involves room temperature or colder water for the entirety of the process. On the other hand, the "hot bloom" method involves wetting the grounds in a small amount of hot water for a short period of time (roughly 60 seconds) to release some desirable acids into the coffee. The method is completed with room temperature or colder water and left to slowly extract like a normal cold brew. The significance of this method is that the hot water releases a small amounts of acids that can complement the produced cold brew's overall flavor profile. Normally, cold brew has little to no acidity because the acids in coffee are only released at higher temperatures. A "bright" coffee is often full of acidic flavor. Personally, I enjoy a more balanced brew, so I am excited to try out this new method for my next brew.
