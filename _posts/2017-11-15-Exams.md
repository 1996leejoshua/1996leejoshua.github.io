Hey guys,

So it's been a while since my last post as exams have come and gone. I've finally finished both rounds of midterms, and I am preparing for finals within the next couple weeks. 

Unfortunately, I did not do as well on my exams as I had hoped. However, my failures give me motivation to do well on my finals. I still have to work more on my time management skills to juggle studying for particular classes.

My next post will probably be less of an update and more of a thoughtful piece. Hope everyone out there is doing well with school or with work!

Josh
