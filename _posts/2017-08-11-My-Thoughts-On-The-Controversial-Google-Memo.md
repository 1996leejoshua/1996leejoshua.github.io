Disclaimer: All opinions in this post are just that: opinions. Nothing I say is meant to offend anyone in any way, and I know that my opinions can be biased by my social circumstances and my gender. I hope that this post can be read from an unopiniated point of view. 

To preface, I believe that Sundar Pichai was correct in his decision of firing James Damore from a CEO's perspective: someone who needs to conter public and professional outlash. If you haven't read the controversial memo, you can read it <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/355823379/Google-s-Ideological-Echo-Chamber#fullscreen&from_embed">here</a>. 

After reading James Damore's memo, I am of the opinion that Damore would not have been fired if this report had stayed an internal document. To expand on that, I agree with Pichai's words in his response to Damore's memo in which he states that Damore had some valid points that should be open to discussion. I agree that, in today's social climate, conservatism is openly frowned upon in a public setting. Obviously, there are cases in which that is not the case, and there are also cases in which conservatives are frowned upon because they are also not open to discussion themselves. It is all a matter of approach and how one reads his memo. I do not have the opinions of a female, so I cannot touch on that point of view.  

As I said previously, I agree with Pichai's response in which he stated that Damore has some valid, arguable points. I also agree that there are some points that do cross the line that society has set. I agree with Damore's point that there is not enough scrutiny in the reverse direction. For example, if a woman had written the same memo from a woman's perspective, I believe that she would not have been fired. More likely than not, it is more likely that an open discussion would have been fostered rather than public outlash. That is just the current state of society today. I am not saying that I disagree with the social movements of today, rather I am just saying that there is sometimes a little too much emphasis placed on certain social movements.
