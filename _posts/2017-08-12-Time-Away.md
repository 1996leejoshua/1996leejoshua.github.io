Today, I took a day trip up to San Luis Obispo to visit a friend, and we went to Montana Del Oro Beach (and later tried Firestone's amazing tri-tip sandwich). You'd think I'd be tired of the ocean having gone to UCSB for 2 years already. However, as I trekked to the top of the sand dune and into view of the ocean, I realized something I had forgotten: I love the view of the ocean, the crashing of the waves, and the salty draft of the water. That feeling of appreciation was something I had forgotten at Santa Barbara despite living just 5 minutes from the beach. Sometimes you just need a different experience (even if it's something extremely similar to what you're used to). I realized that after working for 2 months at my current research position, I was in a rut. 

My friend's housemate said something that sounds ridiculous, but it was something I can relate this experience to: "Do you ever just feel stale? Like bread?" Yeah, he really said that. I laughed too. But thinking about it, sometimes you really do feel stale when you get in a rhythm. You get bored at work. You get lazy at home. Sometimes you just need some time away.
