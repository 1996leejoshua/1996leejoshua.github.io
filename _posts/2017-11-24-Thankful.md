Thanksgiving has always been a time of extra celebration for me and my family since my birthday falls on the 26th of November. This year, as I approach my 21st birthday, I have a lot to reflect upon. My current reflection is based around what I am thankful for this past year. Every year, I've always thought myself to be the wisest and most experienced I've ever been, but for the first time, I don't feel that way. I've realized this year how imperfect I am and how I still have so much to learn. For that, I am thankful. I am thankful because my perspective on change and life have been positively affected. I find myself thinking in terms of the long run as opposed to the present moment. I've found the balance between work and life to be quite delicate, and that sometimes I can't control what's going on around me. All I can do in those moments is to ride the flow and make the best of the opportunities that present themselves. 

I'm thankful for my parents, and the long hours they work just to provide for me and my sister.

I'm thankful for my friends, and the support they've provided this past year.

I'm thankful for my time, and what I'm able to do with it.

As I officially become 21 this Sunday, I look forward to the new challenges and experiences that will come to pass during my 21st year. I'm thankful for it all.

Josh
