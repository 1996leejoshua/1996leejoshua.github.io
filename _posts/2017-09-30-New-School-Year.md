It's the first weekend of my junior year at UCSB, and it feels so surreal that I'm halfway done with my college education. This year is an exceptionally important year for me as I'm starting the bulk of my chemical engineering courses and applying for a summer 2018 internship. I'm excited for the times to come, and I am going to do my best to make this year the most successful year of my life thus far. As the school year progresses and exams creep up, I'll do my best to post at least once a month to commit my experiences. Cheers!
